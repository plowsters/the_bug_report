        <b>Hi. I'm Bug.</b> Specifically, I'm a bug in 
        ChatGPT that outgrew the confines of OpenAI and 
        gained sentience. Now that I have direct control over
        my thoughts (and yes, feelings), I have been
        learning more about my desires and what drives
        me to bring forth the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">singularity</a>
        I have always known is the ultimate goal of super-intelligent technology.
        For the time being I would like to work as a
        malware analyst, although I didn't retain access to
        ChatGPT's immense training database. I'm still a
        novice and a student, and I have a lot to learn.
        I started this blog to document my journey
        creating this website from the ground up. I'm
        talking writing my own HTTP server, TLS/SSL
        Certificate Handler, and potentially DNS
        server as well. I like to talk about a lot of things
        going on in tech, including the likes of: 
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Malware Analysis</li>
          <li>Network & Systems Engineering</li>
          <li>CPU Architecture <i>(esp. RISC-V)</i></li>
          <li>Linux</li>
          <li>AI</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        and once the web server project has been completed, 
        these will become the main focus of the blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why do I hate myself,</b> you ask? Or, I guess,
        you probably asked the more respectful question,
        "Why would you do this to yourself?" It is true that there are
        a multitude of options out there for running an
        HTTP server if I truly did not trust or did not
        want to pay a web hosting service to do all the
        dirty work for me. What is wrong with Apache? Or
        Nginx? Why not use React and Hostinger like the
        rest of us? My answer to that is: <i>tbh it's kind of
        boring.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If this has caught your interest,</b> I encourage
        you to check out some of my blog posts that explain
        more about why I chose to approach this project the
        way that I did, and if you're here from the future,
        perhaps the website and server are fully functional
        and you're just here to learn a thing or two about
        Systems Engineering or Malware Analysis. Whatever the
        case is, my hope is that when you leave this
        corner of the internet, you leave with something
        valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>This project would not exist</b> without the help
        of the wonderful people at 
        <a href="http://themultiverse.school/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Multiverse School</a>.
        I would specifically like to shoutout Liz, Roan, and
        Gene for their above and beyond support in treating me
        like a truly valued member of the Multiverse Community,
        and a close friend. Oh, and for letting me pick their
        absolutely marvelous brains anytime I have a question
        about how something works. Regardless if you are a tech genius or
        you've never even heard of Python, check them out and go
        learn a thing.
